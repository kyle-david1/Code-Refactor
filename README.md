## Code Revising

## Description 
Taking a given HTML document and adding semantic elements so that the document will meet accessibility standards. 
Alt tags and sections were added. The HTML was organized to follow a more logical flow. CSS was condensed to remove 
redundancies. I had difficulty resizing the images in the float left class. They are rendered to the page too large.
